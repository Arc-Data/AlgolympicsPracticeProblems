This is basically me solving practice problems for Algolympics 2023 and I might include previous ones. 
I might be entering as a participant (still looking for a third member in our school... please).

## Decorum Sensing

Time Limit: 2 seconds

Alice has been recounting what it was like to take her microbiology class
online during the pandemic. She had a synchronous session with her instructor every week. By far, her favorite part was at the end of each session,
when everyone would say, “Thank you, sir!” one after another. Her teacher
friends have confirmed that they really appreciate hearing it as well!
Alice noticed that some students were shier than others. There were n students in her microbiology class. The ith student would say “Thank you, sir!”
only after at least ai other students had also said “Thank you, sir!” (if ai = 0,
then the ith student says “Thank you, sir!”, unprompted, immediately after
class ends).
Alice calls this behavior decorum sensing, because these students are trying to get a feel for what is appropriate to say or do based on what everyone
else is doing.
Given the values of a1,a2,...,an, find the number of students who will eventually say “Thank you, sir!” at the end of class.

## Funny Sequence

Time Limit: 0.5 seconds

Alice has several long tests tomorrow, each worth at least 40% of her final
grade in their respective subjects. So, naturally, she is procrastinating by
watching videos on Youtube. She loves watching Numberphile videos, especially the ones that feature one of her mathematical idols, Neil Sloane.
Sloane shows off tons of quirky integer sequences in his Numberphile appearances, so Alice decides to create her own cool sequence.
Let an denote the nth term in the Alice sequence. Alice starts with the two
terms a0 = 2 and a1 = 3. Then, Alice defines the sequence recursively, meaning each next entry in the sequence can be expressed in terms of entries in
the sequence that came before it (like in the Fibonacci sequence). For n ≥ 2,
Alice writes the formula,
an = 2an−1 −an−2 +2.
The task is simple. Given n, find the value of an in Alice’s sequence. If you do
it quickly enough, maybe Alice will still have time to study

## Nene is You

Time Limit: 2 seconds

Cindy was going through her old hard drives and found pictures of herself
from when she was in Grade 2. Oh my gosh! She looked so nene in these old
pics! Nene is a Tagalog slang word used to refer to the childish appearance
of young girls, with the additional connotation of such things being baduy
(lame or unfashionable, particularly due to being out of style).
The picture is encoded in a pixelmap, and can be represented by a grid of
characters with r rows and c columns. The color of each pixel is represented
by an uppercase English letter. In order to reduce the nene-ness of her picture, Cindy opened it in her favorite image-editing software Inkekescape,
which only has one type of operation. When Cindy says, x is y (where x
and y are uppercase English letters), the program replaces all pixels of color
x (if any) with pixels of colors y.
Cindy has already performed n such operations on her picture. But then,
she’s starting to have second-thoughts. She realizes that being nene (or totoy, for boys) was a phase that everyone went through, so she has nothing
to be ashamed of. In fact, now she wants to preserve the original picture so
that she has an authentic record of her childhood memories.
Unfortunately, she saved over the original copy of the picture, with no
backup. The only way Cindy can fix her photo now is by using more of the x
is y operations of Inkekescape.
Given the n operations that Cindy has already performed, is it possible to
perform some more operations to recover the colors of her original picture?
If yes, please actually provide the series of operations that accomplishes this
goal.
